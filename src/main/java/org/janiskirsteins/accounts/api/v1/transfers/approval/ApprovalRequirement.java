/**
 * This class represents a single item of transaction approval requirements.
 *
 * While an internal API could avoid elaborate approval schemes, it could be beneficial
 * to have an approval mechanism that requires outside input for a number of cases. For example:
 *
 * - a non-custodial cryptocurrency account could require a signed transaction from the key holder, to approve
 *   the transaction
 * - a multi-sig account could require multiple users to approve a transaction, before it is allowed through
 * - different approval requirements could be combined. E.g. a transaction goes through if two managers approve
 *   it (multi-sig), OR if the CFO of a company approves it.
 * - multi-factor authentication might require validating a secret in posession of the user
 * - for auditing purposes, certain transfers might require a digital signature by a key held in a hardware security
 *   module
 *
 * And so on.
 *
 * Since approval mechanisms could be pretty complex (and require a lot of work to enable them to be defined and
 * managed), these objects should not be accessed directly, but rather used through an ApprovalService implementation.
 *
 * Each approval requirement has a type, an optional challenge, and an optional response. Challenge/response
 * are optional free-form fields, and the type can help the ApprovalService determine how to validate them.
